when watch the show, sometimes binge watch, sometimes just one episode, stay on top of it
and anytime you can tell, right away, these are episodes I didn't watch yet!

And possibly, by help of your own writing about each episode (note or short summary) you
can remember more clearly if you watch it or not!
